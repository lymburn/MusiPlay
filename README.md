# MusiPlay

Due to Youtube API not allowing for background playback, I decided to not publish the app on the App Store and simply use it in my own life.  

MusiPlay is a music player that streams content from Youtube by using Youtube API v3. It is a personal project that was meant for practicing fundamental iOS skills such as networking, protocols, programmatic autolayout, and JSON persistence with Codable structures.  

Key Features:  
• Streaming of youtube videos by using UIWebKit  
• Creation and management of playlists  
• Ability to browse or search for trending songs  
• Simple playback controls  

Skills Practiced:  
• Practiced networking by making requests to Youtube API  
• Practiced programming autolayout programmatically for greater control over UI  
• JSON parsing with URLSession  
• JSON persistence by utilizing Codable data structures  
• Utilized UIKit elements such as UITableView, UICollectionView, and UITextView to display content
